Getting Started
===============

1. Install Archon from NPM

.. code-block:: javascript

    yarn add @kleros/archon

2. Import Archon into your project

.. code-block:: javascript

    var Archon = require('@kleros/archon')

3. Initialize an instance of Archon using an Ethereum Provider and, optionally, an IPFS Gateway.

.. code-block:: javascript

    // By default Archon uses 'https://gateway.ipfs.io' as the default IPFS gateway. To use your own gateway, pass the gateway URI as the 2nd parameter to Archon.
    var archon = new Archon('https://mainnet.infura.io')

.. note:: A provider is needed so that the codebase knows how to connect to the Ethereum network. You can use a connection to your own node, or to a hosted node such as infura. ``web3.js`` will make RPC calls to the provider to fetch data from the blockchain.

.. note:: A gateway is needed to access ``IPFS`` files that might be referenced in evidence or metaEvidence.

Now you are all set! Use your :ref:`Archon <archon>` object to interact with :ref:`arbitrable <arbitrable>`
and :ref:`arbitrator <arbitrator>` smart contracts on the blockchain.
